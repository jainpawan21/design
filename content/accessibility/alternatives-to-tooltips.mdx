title: Alternatives to tooltips
---

## Overview

Tooltips are frequently used to convey information. However, tooltips are rarely appropriate, and its misuse can result in a myriad of accessibility issues.
Always consider **not** using a tooltip for an improved user experience.

## Why?

- Tooltips are hidden by default making it easy to miss. Never use tooltips to convey critical information.
- Tooltips are not accessible on mobile devices.
- Tooltips should **never** be set on static elements. Tooltips on static elements are not accessible to keyboard users and screen reader users.

If you determine that tooltips are appropriate for your usecase, make sure to carefully follow guidelines set in [PVC: Tooltip component](https://primer.style/view-components/components/alpha/tooltip).

## Guidelines

## What are alternatives to tooltips?

### Always persist the content

### Don't show content

Often, the tooltip content duplicates content that is already available in close proximity on the page. If this is the case, repeating the content with a tooltip is redundant and unnecssary. Consider whether the tooltip
can be removed completely. 

### Use a modal

### Use a disclosure
