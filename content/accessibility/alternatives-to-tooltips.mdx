title: Alternatives to tooltips
---

## Overview

Tooltips are often used to convey information. However, tooltips are rarely appropriate, and its misuse can result in a myriad of accessibility issues.
Always consider **not** using a tooltip for an improved user experience.

## Why?

- Tooltips are hidden by default making it easy to miss, so it should never be used to convey critical information.
- Tooltips are never accessible on mobile devices.
- Tooltips should **never** be set on static elements. Tooltips on static elements are not accessible to keyboard users and screen reader users.

## Guidelines 

### For designers

Only include tooltips on your design as a last resort. Never include tooltips on static elements. 

If you have an appropriate tooltip in your design, be sure to annotate the tooltip carefully with the preferred type (e.g. label or description) to ensure proper semantics.

### For developers

If you come across a design or a page with a tooltip on a static element, remove it. Consult a designer for an alternative way of conveying the information.

If you determine that tooltips are appropriate for your usecase, make sure to carefully follow guidelines set in [PVC: Tooltip component](https://primer.style/view-components/components/alpha/tooltip).

## What are alternatives to tooltips?

### Always persist the content

If possible, always persist the content without using a tooltip. This ensures that the content is always discovered and surfaced to consumers regardless of device.

### Don't show content

Often, tooltips duplicate content that is already available on the page making the tooltip redundant and unnecessary. Consider whether the tooltip can be removed completely. 

### Use a modal

### Use a summary disclosure

<DoDontContainer stacked>
    <Do>
       <Caption>Do use a pattern that is accessible for more groups of users such as a summary disclosure /Caption>
    </Do>
    <Dont>
       <Caption>Don't set tooltips on static elements</Caption>
    </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>
