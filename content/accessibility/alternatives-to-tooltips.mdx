title: Alternatives to tooltips
---

## Overview

Tooltips are frequently used to convey information. However, tooltips are rarely appropriate, and its misuse can result in a myriad of accessibility issues.
Always consider **not** using a tooltip for an improved user experience.

## Why?

- Tooltips are hidden by default making it easy to miss. Never use tooltips to convey critical information.
- Tooltips are not accessible on mobile devices.
- Tooltips should **never** be set on static elements. Tooltips on static elements are not accessible to keyboard users and screen reader users.

If you determine that tooltips are appropriate for your usecase, make sure to carefully follow guidelines set in [PVC: Tooltip component](https://primer.style/view-components/components/alpha/tooltip).

## Guidelines

## What are alternatives to tooltips?

### Always persist the content

If possible, always persist the content without using a tooltip. This ensures that the content is always discovered and surfaced to consumers regardless of device.

### Don't show content

Often, tooltips duplicate content that is already available on the page making the tooltip redundant and unnecessary. Consider whether the tooltip can be removed completely. 

### Use a modal

### Use a disclosure
